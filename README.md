---

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
- Firebase project set up. (Follow [Firebase setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs) to configure.)

---

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cricket-venues-app.git
   cd cricket-venues-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Email/Password Authentication** under **Authentication**.
   - Copy your Firebase configuration and paste it into the `firebase.js` file:
     ```javascript
     import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
     import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
     export const auth = getAuth(app);
     ```

4. **Add API Token**:
   - Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` in the API URL with your SportMonks API token in `HomeScreen.js`:
     ```javascript
     const API_URL = "https://cricket.sportmonks.com/api/v2.0/venues?api_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN";
     ```

5. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```
